# Development Documentation

## Development process overview

Story creation was completed at a sprint planning meeting held by the entire team. During this meeting the tasks to develop were laid out, a round of planning poker was played to assign complexity on a scale of 1 - 10, and a developer was assigned  to each task. This process allowed the whole team to stay in sync and work efficiently to complete the required tasks. Coding related tasks were logged using Github issues while other tasks were managed by assignees directly. A discord server was used to help team members stay in contact and to facilitate standup and impromptu meetings.
